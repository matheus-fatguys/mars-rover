# mars-rover
This project was created as a screening process challenge
But I htought it so creative and interesting that a I decided
to improve it with a reinforcement learning agent and a simple GUI

This project uses RL4J and DL4J

NEXT STEPS: 
1 - INTRODUCE GENETIC ALGORITHMS TO PARAMETER TUNING 
2 - HAVE 2 ROVERS COMPETING ON THE SAME SCNEARIUM
